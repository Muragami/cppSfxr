# cppSfxr, a PSG C++ library

**cppSfxr** is a compact Procedural Sound Generation (PSG) library in c++ with both
a C dll wrapper to provide modular loading, and an [luajit](https://luajit.org)
FFI wrapper around that to allow it's use in the [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org)
game engine. The core sound generation engine was originally written by
[DrPetter]https://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html() for the 10th Ludum Dare competition.

It is purely a sound generation library, and has no connections to any audio
rendering engines or systems. The advantage of this is that it is easily compiled
anywhere little endian systems allow. A precompiled dynamic link library is provided
for the following platforms:

* **Windows**: x64cppSfxr.dll, compiled with MSVC, for any Intel AMD64 machine
* **Mac OS X**: x64cppSfxr.dylib, compiled with gcc/clang via brew, for Intel macs.
* **Debian**: x64cppSfxr.so, compiled with gcc, for any Intel AMD64 machine.
